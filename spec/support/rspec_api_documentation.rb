      # Carrier API

      This documentation is intended for carriers as defined in the [carrier documentation](https://www.somleng.org/carrier_documentation.html). The API documentation for Somleng's Open Source implementation of Twilio's REST API is available [here](../twilio_api).

      The Carrier API is intended for carriers who need to automate provisioning of carrier resources (e.g. Accounts) rather that using the dashboard.
      This API is written according to the [JSON API Specification](https://jsonapi.org/). We recommend using a [JSON API Client](https://jsonapi.org/implementations/) for consuming this API.

      ## Authentication

      This API uses Bearer authentication. You must include your API key in the Authorization header for all requests. Your API key is available on the [Carrier Dashboard](https://dashboard.somleng.org/carrier_settings).

      ## Webhooks

      Somleng uses webhooks to notify your application when an event happens in your account.
      Somleng signs the webhook events it sends to your endpoint by including a signature in each event's `Authorization` header.
      This allows you to verify that the events were sent by Somleng, not by a third party.

      All requests are signed using [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) Bearer authentication, according to the HS256 (HMAC-SHA256) algorithm.

      You should verify the events that Somleng sends to your Webhook endpoints. Here's an example in Ruby:

      ```ruby
      JWT.decode(
        request.headers["Authorization"].sub("Bearer ", ""),
        "[your-webhook-signing-secret]",
        true,
        algorithm: "HS256",
        verify_iss: true,
        iss: "Somleng"
      )
      ```
